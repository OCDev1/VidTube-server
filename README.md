# VidTube-Web app (Server)
<img src="/Web-app-Screenshots/logo_vidtube.png" alt="Logo" width="300">
NOTE: This is the server for *part 3* of the project, meaning that it works with the Android app *and* the Web app aswell.

The VidTube app is a video sharing app, made for allowing users across the world to upload and share their video content, comment their thoughts and interact with each other.
This Readme file contains an overview of the web app and its features, along with the server and a guide on how to run it on your machine.

## How To Run
Start by cloning the repository to your IDE of choice, you can do this by opening the terminal and entering this command:
`git clone https://github.com/OCDev1/VidTube-server.git`

Or download the repository to your computer.

If you downloaded the repo-change the directory in your terminal to the downloaded repo directory. (if you cloned to your IDE then ignore this)

Make sure your'e on branch `main-part3`.

While in the project directory run:
### `npm install`

and wait for it to finish installing.

### Setting up config and .env.local
In the project directory go to the "config" folder (its in the main project directory) and inside it you will find a file called ".env.local", inside 
".env.local" change the conncetion string to the connection string of your MongoDB, and change PORT to the port you would like to run on.
it should look something like this:

`CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://localhost:27017/vidtube (change to the connection string of your MongoDB)
PORT=12345 (NOTE: you must use 12345 for it to work)`
there is also `JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key` (you can ignore this)


* Open MongoDB on your computer.

### insertData.js script
* Included in the project is a script called "insertData.js" which will initialize the database with users, videos and comments. we highly reccomend you run this script in order to get the best experience and see all the features (and also to save you some time (: )

* You can run the script by typing `node insertData.js` wait for the script to finish and your database should be initialized with videos, users and comments, hooray!

* NOTE: in order for the DB to be initialized with the users, videos and comments of the script, make sure you dont already have a database called "vidtube" (or else the script won't add it's data), if you do then delete the database and run the script again. 

Now you can run

### `npm start`

In order to run the Android app, start by cloning the repository to Android Studio, you can do this by opening the terminal and entering this command:
`git clone https://github.com/eyalg43/project_android.git`, and move to branch `mainPart3`.

After cloning the repository, open the project in Android Studio.
(Note: if you are using a physical device, make sure to change the code, such that in every place it says "10.0.2.2" change it to your IP address)

In order to run the web app open http://localhost:12345 (replace "12345" with the actual port number you chose in the .env.local file) to view it in your browser.

Now you are all set up, enjoy both the Android app and the Web app!

NOTE: you dont need to add the build from the frontend directory, but if you do, make sure not to delete any of the photos and videos in the "public" folder in this project, or else the insertData.js script wont be able to add it's data.

## Our work process:
Again, we started off by watching Hemi's videos in the moodle, they helped us understand how the server should work with the client side we built on the first part of the project. Each member of the group was working on a different part of the server, Max worked on the videos part, Eyal worked on the users part, and Omri worked on the comments part. We then connected the server to work with the client side but before we did it, we modified the client side to work with, POST, GET and more methods in order for it to work with the server. Then after that worked we connected a Mongo database to work with the server.

## Web App Features:

### NEW!
* You can now delete your account or edit your user details in your profile page.

* in the watch video screen, clicking the uploaders image or name will take you to his profile page where you can see more videos that he uploaded.

* Users can now edit and delete only their own comments and videos.
